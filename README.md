Brain Stroke disease Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decison Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN.
In our project, we addressed a critical issue in healthcare â€“ the early detection and management of Brain Stroke disease. Through the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a methodology aimed at accurately identifying individuals with Brain Stroke disease, thus facilitating timely intervention and treatment. Through the implementation of Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, we have demonstrated promising results in accurately identifying potential instances of brain strokes. The utilization of these diverse algorithms has allowed us to assess their individual strengths and weaknesses in the context of stroke detection, providing valuable insights for future research and clinical applications. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning techniques to assist healthcare professionals in timely and accurate diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of stroke-related disabilities. As we move forward, further refinement and validation of these models on larger datasets and real-world scenarios will be essential to enhance their reliability and effectiveness in clinical practice. By continuing to leverage the power of machine learning, we aim to contribute towards the development of advanced diagnostic tools for the early detection and prevention of brain strokes, ultimately saving lives and improving the quality of patient care. 
These are some of the snapshots of our project.
